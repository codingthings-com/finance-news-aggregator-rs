# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive integration tests for all news source modules in the finance-news-aggregator-rs library. The integration tests will validate that each public function in the news source modules (CNBC, CNN Finance, Market Watch, NASDAQ, Seeking Alpha, WSJ, and Yahoo Finance) works correctly with real network requests and returns properly structured data.

## Glossary

- **Integration_Test_Suite**: The complete collection of integration tests that validate news source functionality with real network calls
- **News_Source_Module**: Individual modules (CNBC, CNNFinance, MarketWatch, NASDAQ, SeekingAlpha, WallStreetJournal, YahooFinance) that implement news fetching functionality
- **Public_Function**: Any function with public visibility in the news source modules that can be called by external code
- **NewsArticle**: The structured data type returned by news source functions containing title, link, description, and other article metadata
- **Test_Client**: HTTP client instance used for making network requests during integration testing
- **Feed_Endpoint**: Specific RSS or API endpoint for a particular news category or topic

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want comprehensive integration tests for all news source modules, so that I can ensure the library works correctly with real news feeds and catch breaking changes in external APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL test every public function in each News_Source_Module
2. WHEN a public function is called during testing, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL validate that the function returns a Result type without errors
3. WHEN NewsArticle data is returned, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL verify that at least one article contains non-empty title and link fields
4. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL include tests for all seven News_Source_Module implementations (CNBC, CNNFinance, MarketWatch, NASDAQ, SeekingAlpha, WallStreetJournal, YahooFinance)
5. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL use real network requests to validate actual API functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using this library, I want integration tests that validate data structure integrity, so that I can trust the NewsArticle objects returned by the library contain valid and usable data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests fetch news articles, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL validate that returned NewsArticle objects have properly structured fields
2. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL verify that article links are valid URLs when present
3. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL confirm that publication dates follow expected format patterns when present
4. WHEN testing available_topics functions, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL verify that returned topic lists are non-empty
5. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL validate that base_url functions return properly formatted URL strings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline operator, I want integration tests that can run reliably in automated environments, so that I can detect API changes and network issues before they affect production code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL handle network timeouts gracefully without causing test suite failures
2. WHEN external APIs are temporarily unavailable, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL complete execution within reasonable time limits for CI environments
4. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL be organized in separate test modules for each News_Source_Module
5. WHEN running in CI environments, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL support conditional execution based on environment variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a library contributor, I want integration tests that cover edge cases and error conditions, so that the library handles various real-world scenarios robustly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL test functions that accept topic parameters with both valid and available topic values
2. WHEN testing functions with symbol parameters, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL use realistic stock ticker symbols
3. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL validate that name() functions return consistent string values
4. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL test client initialization with default configurations
5. WHEN testing fetch_feed functions, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL verify that different topic categories return distinct content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want integration tests that identify deprecated endpoints and outdated links, so that I can remove broken functionality and maintain a clean, working codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests encounter HTTP 404 or 403 errors, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL log these as deprecated endpoints for removal consideration
2. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL track and report functions that consistently fail due to outdated URLs or API changes
3. WHEN testing reveals broken feed endpoints, THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL provide clear identification of which specific functions and topics are affected
4. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL distinguish between temporary network issues and permanent endpoint deprecation
5. THE Integration_Test_Suite SHALL generate reports identifying candidates for removal from the implementation
